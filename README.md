# Aadhaar Enrolment Data Analysis (2025)

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts for analyzing Aadhaar enrolment datasets provided by UIDAI. The project aims to extract actionable insights from the data to support:

- Policy researchers: Understanding which age groups and regions require awareness campaigns for timely Aadhaar enrolment.
- Operational teams: Identifying pincode-level enrolment trends to optimize staffing and resource allocation at enrolment centers.
- Government stakeholders: Providing data-driven recommendations for improving Aadhaar enrolment efficiency and outreach.

## Project Highlights

- Merges multiple large CSV datasets into a single DataFrame.
- Cleans and preprocesses data for accurate analysis.
- Generates visualizations for:
  - Monthly enrolments at national, state, and district levels.
  - Age-wise enrolment trends.
  - Pincode-level analysis for operational insights.
- Supports dynamic user input for focused analysis (e.g., select state/district/pincode).
